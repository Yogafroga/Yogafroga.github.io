# How hard it is to be a dummy

Not gonna lie, I spent the entire yesterday trying to figure out how to set a website for my personal devlog. 
This might raise a question: why would you ever make a website, whereas you can just make a social media account for the whole thing?
Well, that's a nice point. And I've considered this option many times. But I'm an IT guy in the first place. And that's a shame I haven't even tried to create my own static website yet. So, eventually, I made it. Since this very day, I will be posting small bits of progress here. Any idea, any art or any mechanic will end up being posted on this website.
