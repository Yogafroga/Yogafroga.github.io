# An idea about a game, set in a simulation
This game idea is the reason I decided to make this website. I found the concept so good that I felt the immediate need to share it with someone.
I will try to explain the whole concept as wide and vivid as possible. 

Decent amount of time passed after The First Great Space Expedition. People discovered all things they wanted, all planets were scanned in order to find an alien source of life. Nothing was found.
In some hundreds of years, humanity were run out of new things to come up with. New ideas were no longer able to be born. That started a whole discussion about a human progress among a group of scientists. They realised that they reached a point of the greatest possible progress. It was clear that it is nothing but degradation that awaits the humanity. However, they were driven to find a new source of ideas and creativity. 
One day, scientist Dan Yozenhof found an archive on a social/psychological experiment conducted in the far past. The goal of experiment was to create a whole new society of people with a new language, culture and traditions from a blank sheet, without this community ever realising that they are actually artificially created. 
Unfortunately, the experiment failed. Newborn society found out about their creators and attempted to break free from the location of experiment. It was clear that this new society thing should be done on a different planet with different surveilliance technologies. 
And this was the perfect timing for modern day scientists to bring this project back to life. It was given a name: "Elysium"

A few decades of setting up and the project was launched on a far away planet. After hundreds of in-Elysium years, scientists decided to send a group of explorers to see how things goin on this new promised land.

This is how the game starts. 

The main goal of the character is to find out as much as possible about the new world and its inhabitants. The main gameplay gimick is a thought collection.

Actually, NO, wait a minute. A science expedition is hella boring. I feel like I need to implement a good protagonist that will explore this world for the first time, like a player. 
Indeed, he will be a stranger from some random far part of an explored outer space.
