Welcome to my personal website. I will be posting some stuff here from time to time(rn dedicated to do so every day)
My actual name is Yoga Froga and I am from Russia. Do some music, art(really rare nowadays) and, mostly, create game ideas. 
Recently, I got pretty much bored with my so-called "drawer-writing", where I never shared any of my ideas. Now I am going to test my communication skills with yall.
Hope you will find some cool posts here. Enjoy!
